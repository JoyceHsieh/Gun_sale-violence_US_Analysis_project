Presents mass shooting data exported (GVA) from 1/1/2019 to 9/30/2021 to show how mass shootings incidents in the United States changed from the pre pandemic year of 2019 through September 2021. GVA defines mass shooting incidents based only on the numeric value of 4 or more shot or killed, not including the shooter. In addition to the mass shooting incident dataset described, we have also provided gun sales information for the same years. Although presented together, at this time we do not draw conclusions about the relationship between the two datasets.
